Summary: בתי טמפלרים במרחק 10 דקות נסיעה בבית לחם הגלילית ואלוני אבא.

Tabash is perfectly situated to explore the lower galilee area. Acre to the Sea of Galilee, Haifa to Megiddo all in less than half an hour drive. Bethlehem of Galilee and Alone Aba are both 5 minute drive away, both villages are well-known for the Templer houses built by German settlers at the end of the 19th century. It is well-worth hiking these villages with their picturesque scenery of the native forests in the close by Alonei Aba reservation.
