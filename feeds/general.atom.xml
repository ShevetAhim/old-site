&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, for those who still do not know, is the first decentralized
digital currency in the world. And as such it makes payment a lot
easier. We will not describe it here in details, but here is a good
start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, when we started to work on the camplodge garden we decided to
dug it out. The dipper we dug we realized that it has a round shape and
it can collect water naturally, as it already happened underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, with a little help from some friends, we dug it all the
way to it's rocky bottom. Soon will come the rain which will do its part
of the work: cleaning the mud and filling the hole with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be next with the hole? We still does't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can help us to decide...&lt;/p&gt;
