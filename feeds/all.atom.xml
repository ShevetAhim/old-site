It is most pleasant to walk around the village and get a sense of the Bedouin way of life and the different rhythms of life through the changing seasons, for example, sowing the fields in winter, harvesting in spring, picking the olives  in the end of summer and the famous wedding season from spring to end of summer.
You can take part in those activities and be a part of it.

interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Lost interest? Maybe. But those of us who
are still excited about the beauty of nature and its surprises, those
who still have an adventurous soul, will most likely be happy to join

style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;"&gt;What is
Geocaching?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;For more than a century, millions of
"Treasure Hunters" (Geocachers) all over the world wonder the outdoors
searching for treasures hidden in fascinating places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Due to the availability of GPS in many of
today's devices, the participants navigate to the treasures by using GPS
coordinates that are published in advance in one of the main Geocaching
websites. The treasures are small boxes that are hidden in different
outdoor locations and contain a visitor logbook and sometimes also token
value surprises. Those who find the treasure are invited to mark this in
the visitor logbook and the Geocaching website, and are requested to
return the box to its original place. In addition, the finder is welcome
to take any of the token value surprises but is expected to replace them
with new token value surprises intended for the following Geocachers
participants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

you need in order to start playing is a GPS device and to sign up in one
of the websites. There are several such websites, with the main one

We recommend you sign up through Geocaching.com in order to find
treasures more easily. If you have a GPS-standalone device it is great,
but please note that most cell phones today support GPS so you don’t
need to hassle with a dedicated GPS device, just download one of the
applications for &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;Recently, when we started to work on the camplodge garden we decided to
dug it out. The dipper we dug we realized that it has a round shape and
it can collect water naturally, as it already happened underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, with a little help from some friends, we dug it all the
way to it's rocky bottom. Soon will come the rain which will do its part
of the work: cleaning the mud and filling the hole with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will be next with the hole? We still does't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can help us to decide...&lt;/p&gt;
