It is most pleasant to walk around the village and get a sense of the Bedouin way of life and the different rhythms of life through the changing seasons, for example, sowing the fields in winter, harvesting in spring, picking the olives  in the end of summer and the famous wedding season from spring to end of summer.
You can take part in those activities and be a part of it.
In the village we have a small grocery shop, a bakery and a local restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Attractions"></category><category term="Bedouin village"></category><category term="Shepherds"></category><category term="Galilee"></category><category term="hospitality"></category></entry><entry><title>Hiking and bicycling</title><link href="https://galilee-bedouin-camplodge.com/attractions/nature-reserves.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-07T18:56:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-07T18:56:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Izhar Gurion</name></author><id>tag:galilee-bedouin-camplodge.com,2014-11-07:/attractions/nature-reserves.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The nature reserves of Allone Aba and Tzipori river are just around the corner&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our place is situated between two nature reserves, the Alonei Aba nature reserve on the one side and the Tzippori river nature reserve on the other side.
Aloney Aba is a 235-acres nature reserve, home to the Valonia oak trees and Palestine oak.
The Tzippori Brook flows down the Nazareth Mountains through the valley below the village, where Eyn Yivka spring is located.
The spring flows into a large pond with walls constructed during the Roman period.
The spring is surrounded by pomegranate orchards and green patches of grass, which stretch over an old road along the river leading to the Carmelite Monk Wheat Mill from the Ottoman period.
You can tour the national reserves by hiking or by bicycle (bicycle rental available at 24 hrs notice).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Attractions"></category><category term="nature reserves"></category><category term="Tzippori river"></category><category term="oak trees"></category><category term="Nazareth Mountains"></category><category term="Eyn Yivka spring"></category><category term="Roman period"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="bicycle"></category></entry></feed>
